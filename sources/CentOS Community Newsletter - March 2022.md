CentOS Community Newsletter, March 2022
======

## Project News

### GitLab for CentOS SIGs

Pierre-Yves Chibon posted a proposal to centos-devel about [making GitLab available to CentOS SIGs][1]. People involved with Special Interest Groups are encouraged to read the proposal and respond with questions or details of whether this proposal would help their SIG.

### Automovite Stream Distribution

The [Automotive SIG][2] has announced the Automotive Stream Distribution, a binary distribution developed within the SIG that serves as a public, in-development preview of the upcoming Red Hat in-vehicle OS. Read more in their [blog post][3].

## SIG Reports

[Special Interest Groups][4] (SIGs) are the most interesting part of the CentOS project - this is where people build value on top of the CentOS platform. SIGs report quarterly on what they’ve been up to. Here are this month’s reports.

### Artwork SIG

#### Purpose

The CentOS [Artwork SIG][5] exists to produce the CentOS Project visual identity.

#### Membership Update

There is not membership changes. We are always looking for new members.

#### Releases

None.

#### Healthy and Activity

Health: We are here; doing what we can, when we can.

Recent activities:

- > The CentOS Symbol redesign is on hold. There are some visual blockers (see [https://git.centos.org/centos/Artwork/issue/5][6]) that must be solved. Changing the symbol must not be taken lightly.
- > The CentOS Type change proposal hasn’t been applied on distribution yet. So, its propagation on websites has been postponed as well. We need to coordinate if we are going to apply that change. See [https://git.centos.org/centos/board/issue/71][7]
- > We are looking for a solution related to the lack of horizontal space in the presentation of mailing list messages ([https://github.com/CentOS/ansible-role-mailman/issues/15][8]). Thanks to mroche for reporting this on centos-devel IRC channel.

#### Issues for the Board

None.

### OpsTools SIG

The [OpsTools SIG][9] provides tools for operators, system administrators, devops and developers doing infrastructure engineering on content based on CentOS Linux.

#### Purpose

The purpose of the CentOS [OpsTools SIG][9] is to provide tools and documentation, recommendation and best practices for operators of large infrastructure.

#### Membership update

Sadly, we did not attract new volunteers to contribute to the SIGs purposes, but at the same time, we didn’t lose any.

#### Activity

As follow-up of deprecating and removing CentOS 8, we’ve updated our CI, rebuilt collected and related packages for both CentOS Stream 8 and CentOS Strem 9. We also updated and provided centos-release-opstools packages for both CentOS Stream releases.

#### Issues for the board

Nothing to report.
